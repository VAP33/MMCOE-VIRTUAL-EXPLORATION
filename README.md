# MMCOE Virtual Exploration Game

Welcome to the **MMCOE Virtual Exploration** game! This project allows users to explore the different educational labs and centers at MMCOE (M. M. College of Engineering) through an interactive, gamified experience.

## Project Overview

MMCOE Virtual Exploration combines a map-based idea with an engaging game. The game allows users to virtually navigate through key locations within the college, such as labs, educational centers, and recreational areas. Built with **JavaScript**, the game offers an immersive tour of the college's facilities.

## Research and Inspiration

We began by researching different concepts for our mini-project, including:
- A **Map** system for educational exploration.
- A **Game** concept, inspired by the Google Doodle game "The Champion Islands."
- A **Website** dedicated to human welfare, focusing on educational accessibility.

## Features

### Phase 1 (Current Version)
- **Explorable Locations:**
  - Engineering Exploration Lab
  - Physics Lab
  - Playground
  - Performing Arts Center
  - Artificial Intelligence Lab

### Future Phases (Planned)
- Expansion to include additional labs and educational sites at MMCOE.
- Further enhancements and features based on user feedback and educational progress.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** for game development.
- **Deepnight Games RPG** for crafting the game maps.
- **GitHub** for hosting the source code.
- **Rosebud.com** for game publishing.

## Development

### Building the Game

The game was developed with a focus on:
